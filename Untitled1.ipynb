    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "ans=SQL databases, also known as Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), store data in tables with predefined schemas. The data is organized into rows and columns, and relationships between tables are established using keys. SQL databases are widely used for their ability to handle complex queries and transactions, making them a popular choice for applications that require high levels of data consistency and reliability. Some examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, store data in a variety of formats such as key-value pairs, documents, or graphs. They are often used\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Model: SQL databases are based on a rigid and structured data model, where data is stored in tables and follows a specific schema. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are schema-less and can store data in a variety of formats, including key-value pairs, documents, and graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: SQL databases typically scale vertically by adding more processing power, memory, or storage to a single server. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, can scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers, making them more suitable for applications that require high levels of scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query Language: SQL databases use the Structured Query Language (SQL) to query and manipulate data. NoSQL databases use a variety of query languages depending on the specific database and data model, including MongoDB Query Language (MQL) for MongoDB and Gremlin for graph databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency: SQL databases typically enforce strict data consistency and ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties, making them ideal for applications that require high levels of data integrity. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, often sacrifice some level of consistency for greater scalability and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SQL databases are ideal for applications that require high levels of data consistency, while NoSQL databases are better suited for applications that require high levels of scalability and flexibility with unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",

    "Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "ans=DL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a subset of SQL used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints. DDL commands are used to define the structure of a database and its objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the explanations and examples of some common DDL commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE: The CREATE command is used to create new database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints. For example, the following SQL statement creates a new table called \"employees\" with columns for \"id\", \"name\", \"age\", and \"salary\":\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n",
    "    age INT,\n",
    "    salary DECIMAL(10,2)\n",
    ");\n",
    "DROP: The DROP command is used to delete an existing database object. For example, the following SQL statement deletes the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "ALTER: The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. For example, the following SQL statement adds a new column called \"email\" to the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(100);\n",
    "TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE command is used to remove all data from a table while keeping the table structure intact. This is useful when you want to remove all data from a table but keep the table itself. For example, the following SQL statement removes all data from the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "These DDL commands are essential to managing the structure of a database and its objects. They allow you to create new tables, modify existing tables, delete tables, and remove data from tables. It's important to use these commands carefully and with caution, as they can have a significant impact on your database and the data it contains.\n",
    "Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "ans=DML stands for Data Manipulation Language, which is a subset of SQL used to manipulate the data stored in a database. DML commands are used to insert, update, and delete data from tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the explanations and examples of some common DML commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT: The INSERT command is used to insert new data into a table. For example, the following SQL statement inserts a new row into the \"employees\" table with values for \"id\", \"name\", \"age\", and \"salary\":\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO employees (id, name, age, salary) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 30, 50000);\n",
    "DELETE: The DELETE command is used to remove data from a table. For example, the following SQL statement removes the employee with \"id\" 1 from the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.\n",
    "ans=DQL stands for Data Query Language, which is a subset of SQL used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. DQL commands are used to query the database and retrieve specific data that meets certain criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the explanation and an example of the most commonly used DQL command:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT: The SELECT command is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. For example, the following SQL statement retrieves all data from the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "SELECT * FROM employees;\n",
    "This statement retrieves all columns and rows from the \"employees\" table. You can also specify specific columns to retrieve by replacing the * with the column names separated by commas, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "SELECT name, age FROM employees;\n",
    "This statement retrieves only the \"name\" and \"age\" columns from the \"employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also filter the data by adding a WHERE clause to the SELECT statement. For example, the following SQL statement retrieves all employees who are older than 30:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 30;\n",
    "This statement only retrieves rows where the \"age\" column is greater than 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you can use aggregate functions like COUNT, AVG, SUM, MIN, and MAX to perform calculations on the data. For example, the following SQL statement retrieves the average salary of all employees:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;\n",
    "This statement calculates the average value of the \"salary\" column from the \"employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "These DQL commands are essential to retrieving data from a database. They allow you to query the database and retrieve specific data that meets certain criteria. It's important to understand the syntax of these commands and how to use them effectively to retrieve the data you need.\n",

    "Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "ans=A primary key is a unique identifier for a particular record in a database table. It uniquely identifies each row of data within the table and ensures that no two rows have the same value. A primary key can be a single column or a combination of multiple columns. It is used to enforce data integrity and maintain the consistency of the data in the table. When a table has a primary key, it allows for efficient searching and retrieval of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a combination of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables and maintains referential integrity between them. The foreign key ensures that the values in the referencing table exist in the referenced table's primary key column. This is used to ensure that data is consistent across tables, and it can be used to enforce constraints and maintain data integrity. A foreign key can also be used to retrieve data from multiple tables using a join operation.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the example above, we first establish a connection to the database using the mysql.connector.connect() method. Then, we create a cursor object using the cursor() method. We use the execute() method to execute a SQL query and fetch the result using the fetchall() method. Finally, we loop through the result set and print each row.\n",
